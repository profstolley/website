    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Professor Stolley. I'm starting my, um, 11th year as faculty at IIT. I'm
      faculty in both the ITM and Humanities departments, and I teach mostly web
      development courses. I've written a book on web design, which is now in its
      second edition, and we'll be reading that for this class.

      I live on the northwest side of the city, in the Logan Square neighborhood.
      I love the outdoors, whether its working in my yard or hanging out on the
      patio with my dog, Hank. Speaking of Hank, he's the best:

        Hank, who is a super cute brown and white pitbull,
        loves to curl up and sleep on expensive leather
        furniture. But he's allowed to.

      I'm looking forward to teaching this class and getting to know everyone this
      semester.
