  <h1>Karl Stolley</h1>
  <p>
    I'm Professor Stolley. I'm starting my, um, 11th year as faculty at IIT. I'm
    faculty in both the ITM and Humanities departments, and I teach mostly web
    development courses. I've written a book on web design, which is now in its
    second edition, and we'll be reading that for this class.

  <p>
    I live on the northwest side of the city, in the Logan Square neighborhood.
    I love the outdoors, whether its working in my yard or hanging out on the
    patio with my dog, Hank. Speaking of Hank, he's the best:

    I'm looking forward to teaching this class and getting to know everyone this
    semester.
