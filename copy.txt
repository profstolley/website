I'm Professor Stolley. I'm starting my, um, 11th year as faculty at IIT. I'm
faculty in both the ITM and Humanities departments, and I teach mostly web
development courses. I've written a book on web design, which is now in its
second edition, and we'll be reading that for this class.

I live on the northwest side of the city, in the Logan Square neighborhood. I
love the outdoors, whether its working in my yard or hanging out on the patio
with my dog, Hank. Speaking of Hank, he's the best:

I'm looking forward to teaching this class and getting to know everyone this
semester.
